# Predicting Stock Price Index using the Wavelet Transform and Temporal Fusion Transformer Model

# Overview
1. For reduce noise of Stock price data, preprocessing the data with Wavelet Transform.
2. Transformer models were used to improve errors that occur when predicting long-term time series data.
3. Transformer models extract the points in time series that are relevant for prediction through attention, enabling more accurate forecasts.
